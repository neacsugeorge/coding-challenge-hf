# Intro

Hi there ðŸ‘‹

First, thank you for taking the time to check my submission for the technical challenges I received. I had a great deal of fun working on them and am looking forward to discussing my solutions.

I checked my solution in the following browsers:
- Google Chrome 125.0.6442.113
- Safari 17.4 (I had to change advanced settings since the Tab key focuses only text fields and pop-up menus by default)
- Firefox 127.0

# Custom Checkbox Challenge

This was pretty straightforward; there was no need for JS since we could leverage CSS pseudo-class `:checked`.


# JSON Explorer Challenge

I went with the naive implementation, but I have some interesting ideas about how we can make it support heavy JSON files.

Started with a `react-ts` Vite template and reproduced only the input Property and the Response section. I also took time to setup and write some tests.

I've also added a file input to test some of your JSON files for convenience.

I am aware of certain bugs and am looking forward to seeing if you find them.
